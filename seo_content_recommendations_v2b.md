WEBSITE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCESAGE.AI
==============================================

PRIORITY 1 — HERO SECTION REWRITE
-----------------------------------
CURRENT (change this):
  "SourceSage AI: Digital Twin for Industrial & Agricultural Parts Enterprises"
  "Scalable AI Solutions for Machinery Parts Importers, Wholesalers, and Distributors"

REPLACE WITH:
  Headline:
  "When Your Best Parts Expert Leaves, Your Business Leaves With Them."

  Subheadline:
  "SourceSage AI captures your team's decades of technical knowledge — and handles 
  your WhatsApp inquiries automatically. So your business keeps running, even when 
  your people don't."

  Primary CTA (keep):
  "Book 30-Min Consultation"

  Secondary CTA (add):
  "See a Live Demo →"


PRIORITY 2 — PROBLEM SECTION REWRITE
--------------------------------------
Pain Point 1:
  Icon: person walking out door
  Headline: "Your Top Technician Is Leaving"
  Body: "3 people hold 30 years of parts knowledge in their heads. 
  When they go, that knowledge walks out with them. SourceSage creates 
  a permanent digital record of everything they know — before they leave."

Pain Point 2:
  Icon: whatsapp / message bubble
  Headline: "100+ WhatsApp Inquiries. 2 Staff. Every Day."
  Body: "Your team spends hours identifying parts, checking stock, and quoting 
  prices manually. SourceSage answers technical B2B inquiries instantly and 
  accurately — 24/7, without extra headcount."

Pain Point 3:
  Icon: magnifying glass / parts
  Headline: "Wrong Part Shipped = Lost Customer"
  Body: "Misidentified OEM vs aftermarket numbers cost you margins and 
  relationships. SourceSage validates every part number against your catalog 
  before a quote goes out."


PRIORITY 3 — NICHE DOWN THE VERTICAL FOCUS
--------------------------------------------
REMOVE from hero and above-the-fold:
  - "marine engines"
  - "diesel generators"
  - "global supply chains"
  - "irrigation"
  - "harvesters"

KEEP only in hero/above-fold:
  - Kubota
  - Yanmar
  - John Deere
  - Agricultural machinery
  - Malaysia

(Other verticals can remain lower on page or on separate landing pages)


PRIORITY 4 — SOCIAL PROOF SECTION (ADD — currently missing)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Add section above final CTA:

  "[Customer Name], Operations Manager at [Company], Selangor"
  "We used to spend 4 hours a day answering the same WhatsApp questions 
  about Kubota parts. Now SourceSage handles it. Our team focuses on 
  actual sales."

  Stats bar (use real numbers if available, otherwise remove entirely):
  ✓ X distributors onboarded
  ✓ X parts SKUs digitized
  ✓ X WhatsApp inquiries automated/month


PRIORITY 5 — FAQ REWRITE
--------------------------
ADD these two Q&As:

Q: "What happens to our data if we stop using SourceSage?"
A: "Your knowledge base is yours. We provide a full export of all 
digitized parts data, pricing history, and configurations at any time."

Q: "How long does it take to go live?"
A: "Most distributors are live within 2–4 weeks. We handle the 
catalog digitization and WhatsApp integration — your team just 
reviews and approves."


PRIORITY 6 — REMOVE / SIMPLIFY
--------------------------------
Remove or move below fold:
  - "Enterprise SourceSage AI for Global Supply Chains" (too big-company)
  - "Enterprise Digital Twin" feature label → replace with "Your Knowledge Base"
  - "Deep Industry Domain Knowledge into the AI Era" (jargon)

Replace every instance of "Digital Twin" in UI with:
  "AI Knowledge Base" or "AI Expert System"
  (keep "Digital Twin" only inside the FAQ where context is explained)


PRIORITY 7 — ADD WHATSAPP DEMO BUTTON
---------------------------------------
Add floating CTA button, fixed bottom-right corner:

  Label: "Try a Live Demo on WhatsApp →"
  href: "https://wa.me/[YOUR_NUMBER]?text=Hi%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20see%20a%20SourceSage%20demo"
  Background: #25D366 (WhatsApp green)
  Position: fixed, bottom: 24px, right: 24px
  z-index: 999

  This is the highest-converting CTA for a Malaysian SME audience.
